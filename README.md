# Movies-ETL

## Background

Amazing Prime loves the dataset and wants to keep it updated on a daily basis. Britta needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. You’ll need to refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Project
This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files

Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data

Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data

Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

Add to Resources folder with the wikipedia.movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, movies_query.png, and ratings_query.png files.

Create a README.md that describes the purpose of the repository. Although there is no graded written analysis for this Challenge, it is encouraged and good practice to add a brief description of your project.
